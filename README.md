# Hello SuperCollider

## Basic set-up

Start off with the guide in `intro/basic.scd`. `basic/mouse_organ.scd` and `basic/mouse_theremin.scd` demonstrate some of the basic features of the SuperCollider language and execution model.

## Synths

There is some more advanced tomfoolery in the `synths` folder, where there are some examples of how to create and control Synths.

## Playing around

The `demo` directory should have some other interesting examples.
